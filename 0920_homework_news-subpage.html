          A New Song From Future and Drake Is Coming Very Soon
        </h2>

          There's no word yet on whether or not Future and Drake joined Metro Boomin in the studio for his birthday this weekend, but regardless, it looks like we're getting new music from the two very soon anyway.<br><br>
          Recently, producer Zaytoven revealed that Beast Mode 16, the follow-up to Future's 2015 project Beast Mode, is completely finished. Although it doesn't yet have a release date, it can't be that far away, since on the red carpet at the BET Hip Hop Awards, the producer said, "We should be dropping a single within two weeks, and it's featuring Drake."<br><br>
          Zaytover previously said that he and Future have put in a lot of work on the project, so much that the two have over a hundred unreleased songs: "I was with Future maybe three weeks ago, and he was saying, like, you know, 'I want to keep recording songs, but if it came to it, I needed to drop right now, we done. I'm confident in what we got right now to drop another Zaytoven and Future project.'"<br><br>
          Hip hop superstars Drake &amp; Future announced their Summer Sixteen 2016 tour plans last month, with Roy Woods and DVSN on board as the opening acts. After strong ticket sales, they've added a bunch more concerts.<br><br>

          Just this week, the tour has been extended to run from July to mid-October, with more dates added in Drake's homeland of Canada. The new additions are in Toronto, Montreal, Edmonton, Los Angeles, Chicago, Brooklyn, Denver, San Jose, Philadelphia, Newark, and Des Moines.<br><br>

          Last year, Drake and Future did a collaborative album called What A Time To Be Alive and did a limited run of Jungle tour dates together. Drake's highly anticipated album, Views, was released on April 29 and featured Future on the song "Grammys."
